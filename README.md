# 💼 **n8n Automation Projects Portfolio**

Welcome to my **n8n automation portfolio repository** — a curated collection of intelligent workflows I’ve built to automate real-world processes using **n8n**, **Google Sheets**, **Apify**, and **Google Gemini AI**.

Each project includes:

* A **complete JSON workflow** ready to import into n8n.  
* A **clear explanation** of how each node and process works.  
* **Usage guides** and **tips** for customization and automation scheduling.  

These projects demonstrate my ability to design scalable, low-code automations for data collection, AI integration, and business process management.
